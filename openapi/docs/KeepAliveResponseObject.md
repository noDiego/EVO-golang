will change when the set of required properties is changed

GetKeepAliveResponse returns the KeepAliveResponse field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetKeepAliveResponseOk

GetKeepAliveResponseOk returns a tuple with the KeepAliveResponse field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetKeepAliveResponse

`func (o *KeepAliveResponseObject) SetKeepAliveResponse(v KeepAliveResponseObjectKeepAliveResponse)`
