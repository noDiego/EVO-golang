## Methods

### NewKeepAliveObject

`func NewKeepAliveObject() *KeepAliveObject`

NewKeepAliveObject instantiates a new KeepAliveObject object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewKeepAliveObjectWithDefaults

`func NewKeepAliveObjectWithDefaults() *KeepAliveObject`

NewKeepAliveObjectWithDefaults instantiates a new KeepAliveObject object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetKeepAlive

`func (o *KeepAliveObject) GetKeepAlive() BlockCreateObjectBlockCreate`

GetKeepAlive returns the KeepAlive field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetKeepAliveOk

`func (o *KeepAliveObject) GetKeepAliveOk() (*BlockCreateObjectBlockCreate, bool)`

GetKeepAliveOk returns a tuple with the KeepAlive field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetKeepAlive

`func (o *KeepAliveObject) SetKeepAlive(v BlockCreateObjectBlockCreate)`

SetKeepAlive sets KeepAlive field to given value.

### HasKeepAlive

`func (o *KeepAliveObject) HasKeepAlive() bool`

HasKeepAlive returns a boolean if a field has been set.
